# HospitalPortal

An app for managing hospital employees. Employees can be added, removed and loaded from the file system with their relevant information. This porject improved my undertsanding of saved data in an application via a local file system. This highlighted to me the need for a way to handle and access data for applications. As a result, I started to explore SQL and SSMS.
